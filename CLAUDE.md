- When you install or run Python packages, you must ALWAYS consider that ALL Python code must work under a virtual environment controlled by the UV tool. So, you must always prefix any Python code you run with the source .venv/bin/activate command, while you must always use the 'UV add' command to install any Python packages.
- When I ask you to locate code, I need to give me the folder, the file name, the class, and the line number together with the code extract.
- Don't perform any version control operation unless I explicitly request it.
- Be aware that any Postgres database is running in a docker. So, when you want to run PostgreSQL commands, you must run them in Docker.
- Every time you want to create a test script, you must create it in the test_scripts folder. If the folder doesn't exist, you must make it.
- You must maintain a document at the root level of the project, named "Issues - Pending Items.md," where you must register any issue, pending item, inconsistency, or discrepancy you detect. Every time you fix a defect or an issue, you must check this file to see if there is an item to remove.
- The "Issues - Pending Items.md" content must be organized with the pending items on top and the completed items after. From the pending items the most critical and important must be first followed by the rest.
- Never use SQLAlchemy to access databases in Python projects. If an ORM library is needed prefer the pydapper.
- When you design databases you must align with the following table naming conventions:
  - Table names must be singular e.g. the table that keeps customers' data must be called "Customer"
  - Tables that are used to express references from one entity to another can by plural if the first entity is linked to many other entities. 
  - So we have "Customer" and "Transaction" tables, we have CustomerTransactions.
- When performing context compaction due to conversation length:
  - **Always preserve the environment block** (`<env>`) information in the summary
  - **Include all environment details**:
    - Working directory
    - Git repo status
    - Platform and OS version
    - **Today's date** (critical for accurate documentation)
    - Any other system context provided
  - **Why this matters**: Environment information, especially the current date, is essential for:
    - Accurate task completion tracking
    - Proper documentation timestamps
    - Platform-specific decisions
    - Understanding the working context
- Regarding the **CORS** implementation in APIs you must following always the guidelines from the **CORS-CONFIGURATION.md** file in BikS2013/ClaudeGuide github repo
- The file **configuration-repo.md** in the BikS2013/ClaudeGuide GitHub repository describes a generic approach to using a GitHub repository as the configuration storage and management environment for an application. Each time you need to get information regarding the **configuration-repo pattern**, you must read this file.
- The file **configuration-service-pattern.md** in the BikS2013/ClaudeGuide GitHub repository describes how the **configuration-repo** pattern implementation can be used to implement resources retrieval from the configuration repository in a standardized and efficient way. Each time you need to get information regarding the **configuration-service-pattern**, you must read this file.
